SEEU - Data Mining Final Project

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for forecasting the course
of the dollar exchange rate one week ahead. The project utilizes data mining
techniques to analyze historical data from the National Bank of Republic of
Macedonia. The data spans from March 30, 2020, to March 30, 2023, and is in the
form of an Excel spreadsheet. The data has been filtered to include only dollar
values as it is the focus of the project.
